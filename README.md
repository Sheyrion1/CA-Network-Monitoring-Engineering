# Network Monitoring & Alerts — Engineering Reference (Sanitized)

This repository contains a sanitized version of the engineering reference for a multi‑site network monitoring and alerting infrastructure.

The documentation describes how to deploy and operate a monitoring stack using Observium CE, MikroTik scripts, SNMP polling and syslog collection, Telegram/email alerts, backup strategies and future scalability notes.  
All sensitive details such as IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers or credentials have been removed or replaced with placeholders.

For the full sanitized engineering document, see [`docs/CafeAmerica_Network_Monitoring_Engineering.md`](docs/CafeAmerica_Network_Monitoring_Engineering.md).
